<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization. The resources provided by SAMM will aid in:</p>
<p>✦ Evaluating an organization’s existing software security practices.</p>
<p>✦ Building a balanced software security assurance program in well-defined iterations.</p>
<p>✦ Demonstrating concrete improvements to a security assurance program.</p>
<p>✦ Defining and measuring security-related activities throughout an organization.</p>
<p>Version 1.1 of SAMM expanded and restructured its predecessor into four complementary resources: this document that describes the core SAMM model, the How-To Guide that explains how to apply the model, the Quick Start Guide to help accelerate learning and adoption, and the toolbox that provides simple automation for data collection, metrics, and graphs. Furthermore, a number of elements have been renamed to better represent their purpose.</p>
<p>Version 1.5 of SAMM incorporates a refinement of the scoring model to provide more granularity to the scoring in an assessment. Now an organization will get credit for all the related work done in a practice rather than having the base number held at the highest completed maturity level. The updated scoring model has been designed to help SAMM assessors and organizations avoid the awkward discussion on whether to mark an answer yes or no when it is honestly something in between, and to show incremental improvements.</p>
<p>SAMM was defined with flexibility in mind such that it can be utilized by small, medium, and large organizations using any style of development. Additionally, this model can be applied organization-wide, for a single line-of-business, or even for an individual project. Beyond these traits, SAMM was built on the following principles:</p>
<p>✦ An organization’s behavior changes slowly over time - A successful software security program should be specified in small iterations that deliver tangible assurance gains while incrementally working toward long-term goals.</p>
<p>✦ There is no single recipe that works for all organizations - A software security framework must be flexible and allow organizations to tailor their choices based on their risk tolerance and the way in which they build and use software.</p>
<p>✦ Guidance related to security activities must be prescriptive - All the steps in building and assessing an assurance program should be simple, well-defined, and measurable. This model also provides roadmap templates for common types of organizations.</p>
<p>The foundation of the model is built upon the core business functions of software development with security practices tied to each (see diagram below). The building blocks of the model are the three maturity levels defined for each of the twelve security practices. These define a wide variety of activities in which an organization could engage to reduce security risks and increase software assurance. Additional details are included to measure successful activity performance, understand the associated assurance benefits, estimate personnel and other costs.</p>

<p>#<img src="images/UnderstaingModel.png" alt="‘Understanding the Model’ Image pages Here" /> ######SAMM is built upon a collection of security practices that are tied back into the core business functions involved in software development. This section introduces those business functions and the corresponding security practices for each. After covering the high-level framework, the maturity levels for each security practice are also discussed briefly in order to paint a picture of how each can be iteratively improved over time.</p>
<h1 id="business-functions">Business Functions</h1>
<p><strong>At the highest level, SAMM defines four critical business functions.</strong> Each business function is a category of activities related to the nuts-and-bolts of software development, or stated another way, any organization involved with software development must fulfill each of these business functions to some degree.</p>
<p><strong>For each business function, SAMM defines three security practices.</strong> Each security practice is an area of security-related activities that build assurance for the related business function. There are twelve security practices that are the independent silos for improvement that map to the four business functions of software development.</p>
<p><strong>For each security practice, SAMM defines three maturity levels as objectives.</strong> Each level within a security practice is characterized by a successively more sophisticated objective defined by specific activities, and more stringent success metrics than the previous level. Additionally, each security practice can be improved independently, though related activities can lead to optimizations.</p>
<h2 id="governance">Governance</h2>
<p>Governance is centered on the processes and activities related to how an organization manages overall software development activities. More specifically, this includes concerns that impact cross-functional groups involved in development, as well as business processes that are established at the organization level.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy &amp; Metrics</strong> involves the overall strategic direction of the software assurance program and instrumentation of processes and activities to collect metrics about an or- ganization’s security posture.</p>
<p><strong>Policy &amp; Compliance</strong> involves setting up a security, compliance, and audit control framework throughout an organization to achieve increased assurance in software under contruction and in operation.</p>
<p><strong>Education &amp; Guidance</strong> involves increasing security knowledge amongst personnel in software development through training and guidance on security topics relevant to individual job functions.</p>
<p>…<em>more on page 10</em></p>
<h2 id="construction">Construction:</h2>
<p>Construction concerns the processes and activities related to how an organization defines goals and creates software within development projects. In general, this will include product management, requirements gathering, high-level architecture specification, detailed design, and implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Assessment</strong> involves accurately identifying and characterizing potential attacks upon an organization’s software in order to better understand the risks and facilitate risk management.</p>
<p><strong>Security Requirements</strong> involves promoting the inclusion of security-related requirements during the software development process in order to specify correct functional-ity from inception.</p>
<p><strong>Secure Architecture</strong> involves bolstering the design process with activities to promote secure-by-default designs and control over technologies and frameworks upon which software is built.</p>
<p>…<em>more on page 12</em></p>
<h2 id="verification">Verification</h2>
<p>Verification is focused on the processes and activities related to how an organization checks, and tests artifacts produced throughout software development. This typically includes quality assurance work such as testing, but it can also include other review and evaluation activities.</p>
<p><strong>Design Review</strong> involves inspection of the artifacts created from the design process to ensure provision of adequate security mechanisms, and adherence to an organization’s expectations for security.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Review</strong> involves assessment of an organization’s source code to aid vulnerability discovery and related mitigation activities as well as establish a baseline for secure coding expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Security Testing</strong> involves testing the organization’s software in its runtime environment, in order to both discover vulnerabilities, and establish a minimum standard for software releases.</p>
<p>…<em>more on page 14</em></p>
<h2 id="operations">Operations</h2>
<p>Operations entails the processes and activities related to how an organization manages software releases that has been created. This can involve shipping products to end users, deploying products to internal or external hosts, and normal operations of software in the runtime environment.</p>
<p><strong>Issue Management</strong> involves establishing consistent processes for managing internal and external vulnerability reports to limit exposure and gather data to enhance the security assurance program.</p>
<p><strong>Environment Hardening</strong> involves implementing controls for the operating environment surrounding an organization’s software to bolster the security posture of applications that have been deployed.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Enablement</strong> involves identifying and capturing security-relevant information needed by an operator to properly configure, deploy, and run an organization’s software.</p>
<p><em>…more on page 16</em></p>
<h3 id="maturity-levels">Maturity Levels</h3>
<p>Each of the twelve security practices has three defined maturity levels and an implicit starting point at zero. The details for each level differs between the practices, but they generally represent:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="0" type="1">
<li>Implicit starting point representing the activities in the practice being unfulfilled</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol type="1">
<li>Initial understanding and adhoc provision of security practice</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Increase efficiency and/or effectiveness of the security practice</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Comprehensive mastery of the security practice at scale</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Assurance programs might not always consist of activities that neatly fall on a boundary between maturity levels, e.g. an organization that assesses to a Level 1 for a given practice might also have additional activities in place but not such that Level 2 is completed. Prior to v1.5, the organization’s score should be annotated with a “<strong>+</strong>” symbol to indicate there’s additional assurances in place beyond those indicated by the Level obtained. For example, an organization that is performing all Level 1 activities for operational enablement as well as one Level 2 or 3 activity would be assigned a “<strong>1+</strong>” score. Likewise, an organization performing all activities for a security practice, including some beyond the scope of SAMM, would be given a “<strong>3+</strong>” score.</p>
<p>The scoring model has changed in v1.5 to provide more granularity to the scoring in an assessment. Now an organization will get credit for different levels of work they have done within a practice rather than having the base number held at the highest completed maturity level. The scoring is now fractional to two decimal places for each practice and a single decimal for an answer. Questions have also been changed from Yes/No to four options that represent different levels of coverage or maturity. This change will assist practitioners completing SAMM assessments with the inevitable debate whether to mark an answer yes or no when it is honestly something in between.</p>
<p>The primary reason for the scoring change was to ensure organizations would receive full credit for their work in software security and to make it easier to show improvements in scoring when activities and programs grow and mature. The hope is this change will bring us closer to understanding what works in different scenarios for different organizations to benefit all.</p>
<p>The toolbox spreadsheet has been updated to reflect more context aware answers for each of the questions in the assessment. The formulas in the toolbox will also average the answers to calculate the score for each practice, a roll up average for each business function, and an overall score. The toolbox also has updated scorecard graphics that help represent the current score and can help show improvements to the program as the answers to the questions change. The worksheets later in this document are also updated to align with the new scoring model.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No = 0</strong></li>
<li><strong>Few/Some = .2</strong></li>
<li><strong>At Least Half = .5</strong></li>
<li><strong>Many/Most = 1</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="description-of-security-practices">Description of Security Practices</h2>
<h3 id="strategy-metrics">Strategy &amp; Metrics</h3>
<p>The Strategy &amp; Metrics (SM) practice is focused on establishing the framework within an organization for a software security assurance program. This is the most fundamental step in defining security goals in a way that’s both measurable and aligned with the organization’s real business risk.</p>
<p>By starting with lightweight risk profiles, an organization grows into more advanced risk classification schemes for application and data assets over time. With additional insight on relative risk measures, an organization can tune its project-level security goals and develop granular roadmaps to make the security program more efficient. At the more advanced levels within this practice, an organization draws upon many data sources, both internal and external, to collect metrics and qualitative feedback on the security program. This allows fine tuning of cost outlay versus the realized benefit at the program level.</p>
<h3 id="policy-compliance">Policy &amp; Compliance</h3>
<p>The Policy &amp; Compliance (PC) practice is focused on understanding and meeting external legal and regulatory requirements while also driving internal security standards to ensure compliance in a way that’s aligned with the business purpose of the organization.</p>
<p>A driving theme for improvement within this practice is focus on project-level audits that gather information about the organization’s behavior in order to check that expectations are being met. By introducing routine audits that start out lightweight and grow in depth over time, organizational change is achieved iteratively.</p>
<p>In a sophisticated form, provision of this practice entails organization-wide understanding of both internal standards and external compliance drivers while also maintaining low-latency checkpoints with project teams to ensure no project is operating outside expectations without visibility.</p>
<h3 id="education-guidance">Education &amp; Guidance</h3>
<p>The Education &amp; Guidance (EG) practice is focused on arming personnel involved in the software lifecycle with knowledge and resources to design, develop, and deploy secure software. With improved access to information, project teams will be better able to proactively identify and mitigate specific security risks that apply to their organization.</p>
<p>One major theme for improvement across the objectives is providing training for employees, either through instructor-led sessions or computer-based modules. As an organization progresses, a broad base of training is built by starting with developers and moving to other roles throughout the organization, culminating with the addition of role-based certification to ensure comprehension of the material.</p>
<p>In addition to training, this practice also requires pulling security-relevant information into guidelines that serve as reference information to staff. This builds a foundation for establishing a baseline expectation for security practices in your organization, and later allows for incremental improvement once usage of the guidelines has been adopted.</p>

<h2 id="description-of-security-practices-1">Description of Security Practices</h2>
<h3 id="threat-assessment">Threat Assessment</h3>
<p>The Threat Assessment (TA) practice is centered on identification and understanding the project-level risks based on the functionality of the software being developed and characteristics of the runtime environment. From details about threats and likely attacks against each project, the organization as a whole operates more effectively through better decisions about prioritization of initiatives for security. Additionally, decisions for risk acceptance are more informed, therefore better aligned to the business.</p>
<p>By starting with simple threat models and building to more detailed methods of threat analysis and weighting, an organization improves over time. Ultimately, a sophisticated organization would maintain this information in a way that is tightly coupled to the compensating factors and pass-through risks from external entities. This provides greater breadth of understanding for potential downstream impacts from security issues while keeping a close watch on the organization’s current performance against known threats.</p>
<h3 id="security-requirements">Security Requirements</h3>
<p>The Security Requirements (SR) practice is focused on proactively specifying the expected behavior of software with respect to security. Through addition of analysis activities at the project level, security requirements are initially gathered based on the high-level business purpose of the software. As an orga-nization advances, more advanced techniques are used such as access control specifications to discover new security requirements that may not have been initially obvious to development.</p>
<p>In a sophisticated form, provision of this practice also entails pushing the security requirements of the organization into its relationships with suppliers and then auditing projects to ensure all are adhering to expectations with regard to specification of security requirements.</p>
<h3 id="secure-architecture">Secure Architecture</h3>
<p>The Secure Architecture (SA) practice is focused on proactive steps for an organization to design and build secure software by default. By enhancing the software design process with reusable services and components, the overall security risk from software development can be dramatically reduced.</p>
<p>Beginning from simple recommendations about software frameworks and explicit consideration of secure design principles, an organization evolves toward consistently using design patterns for security functionality. Also, activities encourage project teams to increased utilization of centralized security services and infrastructure.</p>
<p>As an organization evolves over time, sophisticated provision of this practice entails organizations building reference platforms to cover the generic types of software they build. These serve as frameworks upon which developers can build custom software with lower risk of vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 id="description-of-security-practices-2">Description of Security Practices</h2>
<h3 id="design-review">Design Review</h3>
<p>The Design Review (DR) practice is focused on assessment of software design and architecture for security-related problems. This allows an organization to detect architecture-level issues early in software development and thereby avoid potentially large costs from refactoring later due to security concerns.</p>
<p>Beginning with lightweight activities to build understanding of the security-relevant details about an architecture, an organization evolves toward more formal inspection methods that verify completeness in provision of security mechanisms. At the organization level, design review services are built and offered to stakeholders.</p>
<p>In a sophisticated form, provision of this practice involves detailed, data-level inspection of designs, and enforcement of baseline expectations for conducting design assessments and reviewing findings before releases are accepted.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-review">Implementation Review</h3>
<p>The Implementation Review (IR) practice is focused on inspection of software at the source code and configuration level in order to find security vulnerabilities. Code-level vulnerabilities are generally simple to understand conceptually, but even informed developers can easily make mistakes that leave software open to potential compromise.</p>
<p>To begin, an organization uses lightweight checklists and for efficiency, only inspects the most critical software modules. However, as an organization evolves it uses automation technology to dramatically improve coverage and efficacy of implementation review activities.</p>
<p>Sophisticated provision of this practice involves deeper integration of implementation review into the development process to enable project teams to find problems earlier. This also enables organizations to better audit and set expectations for implementation review findings before releases can be made.</p>
<h3 id="security-testing">Security Testing</h3>
<p>The Security Testing (ST) practice is focused on inspection of software in the runtime environment in order to find security problems. These testing activities bolster the assurance case for software by checking it in the same context in which it is expected to run, thus making visible operational misconfigurations or errors in business logic that are difficult to otherwise find.</p>
<p>Starting with penetration testing and high-level test cases based on the functionality of software, an organization evolves toward usage of security testing automation to cover the wide variety of test cases that might demonstrate a vulnerability in the system.</p>
<p>In an advanced form, provision of this practice involves customization of testing automation to build a battery of security tests covering application-specific concerns in detail. With additional visibility at the organization level, security testing enables organizations to set minimum expectations for security testing results before a project release is accepted.</p>

<h2 id="description-of-security-practices-3">Description of Security Practices</h2>
<h3 id="issue-management">Issue Management</h3>
<p>The Issue Management (IM) practice is focused on the processes within an organization with respect to handling issue reports and operational incidents. By having these processes in place, an organization’s projects will have consistent expectations and increased efficiency for handling these events, rather than chaotic and uninformed responses.</p>
<p>Starting from lightweight assignment of roles in the event of an incident, an organization grows into a more formal incident response process that ensures visibility and tracking on issues that occur. Communications are also improved to improve overall understanding of the processes.</p>
<p>In an advanced form, issue management involves thorough dissecting of incidents and issue reports to collect detailed metrics and other root-cause information to feedback into the organization’s downstream behavior.</p>
<h3 id="environment-hardening">Environment Hardening</h3>
<p>The Environment Hardening (EH) practice is focused on building assurance for the runtime environment that hosts the organization’s software. Since secure operation of an application can be deteriorated by problems in external components, hardening this underlying infrastructure directly improves the overall security posture of the software.</p>
<p>By starting with simple tracking and distributing of information about the operating environment to keep development teams better informed, an organization evolves to scalable methods for managing deployment of security patches and instrumenting the operating environment with early-warning de- tectors for potential security issues before damage is done.</p>
<p>As an organization advances, the operating environment is further reviewed and hardened by deployment of protection tools to add layers of defenses and safety nets to limit damage in case any vulnerabilities are exploited.</p>
<h3 id="operational-enablement">Operational Enablement</h3>
<p>The Operational Enablement (OE) practice is focused on gathering security critical information from the project teams building software and communicating it to the users and operators of the software. Without this information, even the most securely designed software carries undue risks since important security characteristics and choices will not be known at a deployment site.</p>
<p>Starting from lightweight documentation to capture the most important details for users and operators, an organization evolves toward building complete operational security guides that are delivered with each release.</p>
<p>In an advanced form, operational enablement also entails organization-level checks against individual project teams to ensure that information is being captured and shared according to expectations.</p>

<h5 id="a.-estimate-overall-business-risk-profile.">A. Estimate overall business risk profile.</h5>
<p>Interview business owners and stakeholders and create a list of worst-case scenarios across the organization’s various application and data assets. Based on the way in which your organization builds, uses, or sells software, the list of worst-case scenarios can vary widely, but common issues include data theft or corruption, service outages, monetary loss, reverse engineering, account compromise, etc.</p>
<p>After broadly capturing worst-case scenario ideas, collate and select the most important based on collected information and knowledge about the core business. Any number can be selected, but aim for at least three and no more than seven to make efficient use of time and keep the exercise focused.</p>
<p>Elaborate a description of each of the selected items and document details of contributing worst-case scenarios, potential contributing factors, and potential mitigating factors for the organization.</p>
<p>The final business risk profile should be reviewed with business owners and other stakeholders for understanding.</p>
<h5 id="b.-build-and-maintain-assurance-program-roadmap.">B. Build and maintain assurance program roadmap.</h5>
<p>Understanding the main business risks to the organization, evaluate the current performance of the organization against each the twelve practices. Calculate a score for each practice based on the answers to the multiple choice questions using the toolbox spreadsheet or SAMM survey application.</p>
<p>Once a good understanding of current status is obtained, the next goal is to identify the practices that will be improved in the next iteration. Select them based on business risk profile, other business drivers, compliance requirements, budget tolerance, etc. Once practices are selected, the goals of the iteration are to achieve the next objective under each. Iterations of improvement on the assurance program should be approximately 3-6 months, but an assurance strategy session should take place at least every three months to review progress on activities, performance against success metrics and other business drivers that may require program changes.</p>

<h2 id="activities-1">Activities</h2>
<h5 id="a.-classify-data-and-applications-based-on-business-risk">A. Classify data and applications based on business risk</h5>
<p>Establish a simple classification system to represent risk-tiers for applications. In its simplest form, this can be a High/Medium/Low categorization. More sophisticated classifications can be used, but there should be no more than seven categories and they should roughly represent a gradient from high to low impact against business risks.</p>
<p>Working from the organization’s business risk profile, create project evaluation criteria that maps each project to one of the risk categories. A similar but separate classification scheme should be created for data assets and each item should be weighted and categorized based on potential impact to business risks.</p>
<p>Evaluate collected information about each application and assign each a risk category based upon overall evaluation criteria and the risk categories of data assets in use. This can be done centrally by a security group or by individual project teams through a customized questionnaire to gather the requisite information.</p>
<p>An ongoing process for application and data asset risk categorization should be established to assign categories to new assets and keep the existing information updated at least biannually.</p>
<h5 id="b.-establish-and-measure-per-classification-security-goals">B. Establish and measure per-classification security goals</h5>
<p>With a classification scheme for the organization’s application portfolio in place, direct security goals and assurance program roadmap choices can be made more granular.</p>
<p>The assurance program’s roadmap should be modified to account for each application risk category by specifying emphasis on particular practices for each category. For each iteration of the assurance program, this would typically take the form of prioritizing more higher-level objectives on the highest risk application tier and progressively less stringent objectives for lower/other categories.</p>
<p>This process establishes the organization’s risk tolerance since active decisions must be made as to what specific objectives are expected of applications in each risk category. By choosing to keep lower risk applications at lower levels of performance with respect to the security practices, resources are saved in exchange for acceptance of a weighted risk. However, it is not necessary to arbitrarily build a separate roadmap for each risk category since that can leads to inefficiency in management of the assurance program itself.</p>

<h2 id="activities-2">Activities</h2>
<h5 id="b.-conduct-periodic-industry-wide-cost-comparisons">B. Conduct periodic industry-wide cost comparisons</h5>
<p>Research and gather information about security costs from intra-industry communication forums, business analyst and consulting firms, or other external sources. In particular, there are a few key factors that need to be identified.</p>
<p>First, use collected information to identify the average amount of security effort being applied by similar types of organizations in your industry. This can be done either top- down from estimates of total percentage of budget, revenue, etc. or it can be done bottom-up by identifying security-related activities that are considered normal for your type of organization. Overall, this can be hard to gauge for certain industries, so collect information from as many relevant sources as are accessible.</p>
<p>The next goal of researching security costs is to determine if there are potential cost savings on third-party security products and services that your organization currently uses. When weighing the decision of switching vendors, account for hidden costs such as retraining staff or other program overhead.</p>
<p>Overall, these cost-comparison exercises should be conducted at least annually prior to the subsequent assurance program strategy session. Comparison information should be pre- sented to stakeholders in order to better align the assurance program with the business.</p>
<h5 id="b.-collect-metrics-for-historic-security-spend">B. Collect metrics for historic security spend</h5>
<p>Collect project-specific information on the cost of past security incidents. For instance, time and money spent in cleaning up a breach, monetary loss from system outages, fines and fees to regulatory agencies, project-specific one-off security expenditures for tools or services, etc.</p>
<p>Using the application risk categories and the respective prescribed assurance program roadmaps for each, a baseline security cost for each application can be initially estimated from the costs associated with the corresponding risk category.</p>
<p>Combine the application-specific cost information with the general cost model based on risk category, and then evaluate projects for outliers, i.e. sums disproportionate to the risk rating. These indicate either an error in risk evaluation/classification or the necessity to tune the organization’s assurance program to address root causes for security cost more effectively.</p>
<p>The tracking of security spend per project should be done quarterly at the assurance program strategy session, and the information should be reviewed and evaluated by stakeholders at least annually. Outliers and other unforeseen costs should be discussed for potential affect on assurance program roadmap.</p>

<h5 id="a.-identify-and-monitor-external-compliance-drivers">A. Identify and monitor external compliance drivers</h5>
<p>While an organization might have a wide variety of compliance requirements, this activity is specifically oriented around those that either directly or indirectly affect the way in which the organization builds or uses software and/or data. Leverage internal staff focused on compliance if available.</p>
<p>Based on the organization’s core business, conduct research and identify third-party regulatory standards with which compliance is required or considered an industry norm. Possibilities include the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), etc. After reading and understanding each third-party standard, collect specific requirements related to software and data and build a consolidated list that maps each driver (third-party standard) to each of its specific requirements for security. At this stage, try to limit the amount of requirements by dropping anything considered optional or only recommended.</p>
<p>At a minimum, conduct research at least biannually to ensure the organization is keeping up-dated on changes to third-party standards. Depending upon the industry and the importance of compliance, this activity can vary in effort and personnel involvement, but should always be done explicitly.</p>
<h5 id="b.-build-and-maintain-compliance-guidelines">B. Build and maintain compliance guidelines</h5>
<p>Based upon the consolidated list of software and data-related requirements from compliance drivers, elaborate the list by creating a corresponding response statement to each requirement. Sometimes called control statements, each response should capture the concept of what the organization does to ensure the requirement is met (or to note why it does not apply).</p>
<p>Since typical audit practice often involves checking a control statement for sufficiency and then measuring the organization against the control statement itself, it is critical that they accurately represent actual organizational practices. Also, many requirements can be met by instituting simple, lightweight process elements to cover base-line compliance prior to evolving the organization for better assurance down the road.</p>
<p>Working from the consolidated list, identify major gaps to feed the future planning efforts with regard to building the assurance program. Communicate information about compliance gaps with stakeholders to ensure awareness of the risk from non-compliance.</p>
<p>At a minimum, update and review control statements with stakeholders at least biannually. Depending on the number of compliance drivers, it may make sense to perform updates more often.</p>

<h2 id="activities-3">Activities</h2>
<h5 id="a.-build-policies-and-standards-for-security-and-compliance">A. Build policies and standards for security and compliance</h5>
<p>Beginning with a current compliance guidelines, review regulatory standards and note any optional or recommended security requirements. Also, the organization should conduct a small amount of research to discover any potential future changes in compliance requirements that are relevant.</p>
<p>Augment the list with any additional requirements based on known business drivers for security. Often it is simplest to consult existing guidance being provided to development staff and gather a set of best practices.</p>
<p>Group common/similar requirements and rewrite each group as more generalized/simplified statements that meet all the compliance drivers as well as provide some additional security value. Work through this process for each grouping with the goal of building a set of internal policies and standards that can be directly mapped back to compliance drivers and best practices.</p>
<p>It is important for the set of policies and standards to not contain requirements that are too difficult or excessively costly for project teams to comply. A useful heuristic is that approximately 80% of projects should be able to comply with minimal disruption. This requires a good communications program being set up to advertise the new policies/ standards and assist teams with compliance if needed.</p>
<h5 id="b.-establish-project-audit-practice">B. Establish project audit practice</h5>
<p>Create a simple audit process for project teams to request and receive an audit against internal standards. Audits are typically performed by security auditors but can also be conducted by security-savvy staff as long as they are knowledgeable about the internal standards.</p>
<p>Based upon any known business risk indicators, projects can be prioritized concurrently with audit queue triage such that high-risk software is assessed sooner or more frequently. Additionally, low-risk projects can have internal audit requirements loosened to make the audit practice more cost-effective.</p>
<p>Overall, each active project should undergo an audit at least biannually. Generally, subse-quent audits after the initial will be simpler to perform if sufficient audit information about the application is retained.</p>
<p>Advertise this service to business owners and other stakeholders so that they may request an audit for their projects. Detailed pass/fail results per requirement from the internal standards should be delivered to project stakeholders for evaluation. Where practical, audit results should also contain explanations of impact and remediation recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="activities-4">Activities</h2>
<h5 id="a.-create-compliance-gates-for-projects">A. Create compliance gates for projects</h5>
<p>Once an organization has established internal standards for security, the next level of en-forcement is to set particular points in the project lifecycle where a project cannot pass until it is audited against the internal standards and found to be in compliance.</p>
<p>Usually, the compliance gate is placed at the point of software release such that they are not allowed to publish a release until the compliance check is passed. It is important to provide enough time for the audit to take place and remediation to occur, so generally the audit should begin earlier, for instance when a release is given to quality assurance.</p>
<p>Despite being a firm compliance gate, legacy or other specialized projects may not be able to comply, so an exception approval process must also be created. No more than about 20% of all projects should have exception approval.</p>
<h5 id="b.-adopt-solution-for-audit-data-collection">B. Adopt solution for audit data collection</h5>
<p>Organizations conducting regular audits of project teams generate a large amount of audit data over time. Automation should be utilized to assist in automated collection, manage collation for storage and retrieval, and to limit individual access to sensitive audit data.</p>
<p>For many concrete requirements from the internal standards, existing tools such as code analyzers, application penetration testing tools, monitoring software, etc. can be customized and leveraged to automate compliance checks against internal standards. The purpose of automating compliance checks is to both improve efficiency of audit as well as enable more staff to self-check for compliance before a formal audit takes place. Additionally, automated checks are less error-prone and allow for lower latency on discovery of problems.</p>
<p>Information storage features should allow centralized access to current and historic audit data per project. Automation solutions must also provide detailed access control features to limit access to approved individuals with valid business purpose for accessing the audit data.</p>
<p>All instructions and procedures related to accessing compliance data as well as requesting access privileges should be advertised to project teams. Additional time may be initially required from security auditors to bootstrap project teams.</p>

<h2 id="activities-5">Activities</h2>
<h5 id="a.-conduct-technical-security-awareness-training">A. Conduct technical security awareness training</h5>
<p>Either internally or externally sourced, conduct security training for technical staff that covers the basic tenets of application security. Generally, this can be accomplished via instructor-led training in 1-2 days or via computer-based training with modules taking about the same amount of time per developer.</p>
<p>Course content should cover both conceptual and technical information. Appropriate topics include high-level best practices surrounding input validation, output encoding, error handling, logging, authentication, authorization, and data protection. Additional coverage of commonplace software vulnerabilities is also desirable such as a Top 10 list appropriate to the software being devel-oped (web applications, embedded devices, client- server applications, back-end transaction systems, etc.). Wherever possible, use code samples and lab exercises in the specific pro-gramming language(s) that applies.</p>
<p>To rollout such training, it is recommended to mandate annual security training and then hold courses (either instructor-led or computer-based) as often as required based on development head-count.</p>
<h5 id="b.-build-and-maintain-technical-guidelines">B. Build and maintain technical guidelines</h5>
<p>For development staff, assemble a list of approved documents, web pages, and technical notes that provide technology-specific security advice. These references can be assembled from many publicly available resources on the Internet. In cases where very specialized or pro- prietary technologies permeate the development environment, utilize senior, security-savvy staff to build security notes over time to create such a knowledge base in an ad hoc fashion.</p>
<p>Ensure management is aware of the resources and briefs oncoming staff about their expected usage. Try to keep the guidelines lightweight and up-to-date to avoid clutter and irrelevance. Once a comfort-level has been established, they can be used as a qualitative checklist to ensure that the guidelines have been read, understood, and followed in the development process.</p>

<p>Conduct security training for staff that highlights application security in the context of each role’s job function. Generally, this can be accomplished via instructor-led training in 1-2 days or via computer-based training with modules taking about the same amount of time per person.</p>
<p>For managers and requirements specifiers, course content should feature security requirements planning, vulnerability and incident management, threat modeling, and misuse/abuse case design.</p>
<p>Tester and auditor training should focus on training staff to understand and more effectively analyze software for security-relevant issues. As such, it should feature techniques for code review, architecture and design analysis, runtime analysis, and effective security test planning.</p>
<p>Expand technical training targeting developers and architects to include other relevant topics such as security design patterns, tool-specific training, threat modeling and software assessment techniques.</p>
<p>To rollout such training, it is recommended to mandate annual security awareness training and periodic specialized topics training. Course should be available (either instructor-led or computer-based) as often as required based on head-count per role.</p>
<h5 id="b.-utilize-security-coaches-to-enhance-project-teams">B. Utilize security coaches to enhance project teams</h5>
<p>Using either internal or external experts, make security-savvy staff available to project teams for consultation. Further, this coaching resource should be advertised internally to ensure that staff are aware of its availability. The coaching staff can be created by recruiting experienced individuals within the organization to spend some percentage of their time, around 10% maximum, performing coaching activities. The coaches should communicate between one another to ensure they are aware of each other’s area of expertise and route questions accordingly for efficiency.</p>
<p>While coaches can be used at any point in the software lifecycle, appropriate times to use the coaches include during initial product conception, before completion of functional or detailed design specification(s), when issues arise during development, test planning, and when operational security incidents occur.</p>
<p>Over time, the internal network of coaching resources can be used as points-of-contact for communicating security-relevant information throughout the organization as well as being local resources that have greater familiarity with the ongoing project teams than a purely centralized security team might.</p>

<h5 id="a.-create-formal-application-security-support-portal">A. Create formal application security support portal</h5>
<p>Building upon written resources on topics relevant to application security, create and advertise a centralized repository (usually an internal web site). The guidelines themselves can be created in any way that makes sense for the organization, but an approval board and straightforward change control processes must be established.</p>
<p>Beyond static content in the form of best-practices lists, tool-specific guides, FAQs, and other articles, the support portal should feature interactive components such as mailing lists, web- based forums, or wikis to allow internal resources to cross-communicate security relevant topics and have the information cataloged for future reference.</p>
<p>The content should be cataloged and easily searchable based upon several common factors such as platform, programming language, pertinence to specific third party libraries or frameworks, lifecycle stage, etc. Project teams creating software should align themselves early in product development to the specific guidelines that they will follow. In product as-sessments, the list of applicable guidelines and product-related discussions should be used as audit criteria.</p>
<h5 id="b.-establish-role-based-examinationcertification">B. Establish role-based examination/certification</h5>
<p>Either per role or per training class/module, create and administer aptitude exams that test people for comprehension and utilization of security knowledge. Typically, exams should be created based on the role-based curricula and target a minimum passing score around 75% correct. While staff should be required to take applicable training or refresher courses an- nually, certification exams should be required biannually at a minimum.</p>
<p>Based upon pass/fail criteria or exceptional performance, staff should be ranked into tiers such that other security-related activities could require individuals of a particular certification level to sign-off before the activity is complete, e.g. an uncertified developer cannot pass a design into implementation without explicit approval from a certified architect. This provides granular visibility on an per-project basis for tracking security decisions with individual accountability. Overall, this provides a foundation for rewarding or penalizing staff for making good business decisions regarding application security.</p>

<h5 id="a.-build-and-maintain-application-specific-threat-models">A. Build and maintain application-specific threat models</h5>
<p>Based purely on the business purpose of each software project and the business risk profile (if available) identify likely worst-case scenarios for the software under development in each project team. This can be conducted using simple attack trees or through a more formal threat modeling process such as Microsoft’s STRIDE, Trike, etc.</p>
<p>To build attack trees, identify each worst-case scenario in one sentence and label these as the high-level goals of an attacker. From each attacker goal identified, identify preconditions that must hold in order for each goal to be realized. This information should be captured in branches underneath each goal where each branch is either a logical AND or a logical OR of the statements contained underneath. An AND branch indicates that each directly attached child nodes must be true in order to realize the parent node. An OR branch indicates that any one of the directly attached child nodes must be true in order to achieve the parent node.</p>
<p>Regardless of the threat modeling approach, review each current and historic functional requirement to augment the attack tree to indicate security failures relevant to each. Brain- storm by iteratively dissecting each failure scenario into all the possible ways in which an attacker might be able to reach one of the goals. After initial creation, the threat model for an application should be updated when significant changes to the software are made. This assessment should be conducted with senior developers and architects as well as one or more security auditors.</p>
<h5 id="b.-develop-attacker-profile-rom-sotware-architecture">B. Develop attacker profile rom sotware architecture</h5>
<p>Initially, conduct an assessment to identify all likely threats to the organization based on software projects. For this assessment, consider threats to be limited to agents of malicious intent and omit other risks such as known vulnerabilities, potential weaknesses, etc.</p>
<p>Begin by generally considering external agents and their corresponding motivations for attack. To this list, add internal roles that could cause damage and their motivations for insider attack. Based on the architecture of the software project(s) under consideration, it can be more efficient to conduct this analysis once per architecture type instead of for each project individually since applications of architecture and business purpose will generally be suscep-tible to similar threats.</p>
<p>This assessment should be conducted with business owners and other stakeholders but also include one or more security auditors for additional perspective on threats. In the end, the goal is to have a concise list of threat agents and their corresponding motivations for attack.</p>

<h5 id="a.-build-and-maintain-abuse-case-models-per-project">A. Build and maintain abuse-case models per project</h5>
<p>Further considering the threats to the organization, conduct a more formal analysis to determine potential misuse or abuse of functionality. Typically, this process begins with identification of normal usage scenarios, e.g. use-case diagrams if available.</p>
<p>If a formal abuse-case technique isn’t used, generate a set of abuse-cases for each scenario by starting with a statement of normal usage and brainstorming ways in which the statement might be negated, in whole or in part. The simplest way to get started is to insert the word “no” or “not” into the usage statement in as many ways as possible, typically around nouns and verbs. Each usage scenario should generate several possible abuse-case statements.</p>
<p>Further elaborate the abuse-case statements to include any application-specific concerns based on the business function of the software. The ultimate goal is for the completed set of abuse statements to form a model for usage patterns that should be disallowed by the software. If desired, these abuse cases can be combined with existing threat models.</p>
<p>After initial creation, abuse-case models should be updated for active projects during the design phase. For existing projects, new requirements should be analyzed for potential abuse, and existing projects should opportunistically build abuse-cases for established functionality where practical.</p>
<h5 id="b.-adopt-a-weighting-system-for-measurement-of-threats">B. Adopt a weighting system for measurement of threats</h5>
<p>Based on the established attacker profiles, identify a rating system to allow relative compari- son between the threats. Initially, this can be a simple high-medium-low rating based upon business risk, but any scale can be used provided that there are no more than five categories.</p>
<p>After identification of a rating system, build evaluation criteria that allow each threat to be assigned a rating. In order to do this properly, additional factors about each threat must be considered beyond motivation. Important factors include capital and human resources, inherent access privilege, technical ability, relevant goals on the threat model(s), likelihood of successful attack, etc.</p>
<p>After assigning each threat to a rating, use this information to prioritize risk mitigation activities within the development lifecycle. Once built for a project team, it should be updated during design of new features or refactoring efforts.</p>

<h5 id="a.-explicitly-evaluate-risk-from-third-party-components">A. Explicitly evaluate risk from third-party components</h5>
<p>Conduct an assessment of your software code-base and identify any components that are of external origin. Typically, these will include open-source projects, purchased consumer of the shelf (COTS) software, and online services which your software uses.</p>
<p>For each identified component, elaborate attacker profiles for the software project based upon potential compromise of third-party components. Based upon the newly identified attacker profiles, update software threat models to incorporate any likely risks based upon new attacker goals or capabilities.</p>
<p>In addition to threat scenarios, also consider ways in which vulnerabilities or design flaws in the third-party software might affect your code and design. Elaborate your threat models accordingly with the potential risks from vulnerabilities and knowledge of the updated attacker profile.</p>
<p>After initially conducted for a project, this must be updated and reviewed during the design phase or every development cycle. This activity should be conducted by a security auditor with relevant technical and business stakeholders.</p>
<h5 id="b.-elaborate-threat-models-with-compensating-controls">B. Elaborate threat models with compensating controls</h5>
<p>Conduct an assessment to formally identify factors that directly prevent preconditions for compromise represented by the threat models. These mitigating factors are the compensat- ing controls that formally address the direct risks from software. Factors can be technical features in the software itself, but can also be process elements in the development lifecycle, infrastructure features, etc.</p>
<p>If using attack trees, the logical relationship represented by each branch will be either an AND or an OR. Therefore, by mitigating against just one precondition on an AND branch, the parent and all connected leaf nodes can be marked as mitigated. However, all child nodes on an OR node must be prevented before the parent can be marked as mitigated.</p>
<p>Regardless of threat modeling technique, identify compensating controls and annotate the threat models directly. The goal is to maximize coverage in terms of controls that mark parts of the threat model as mitigated. For any viable paths remaining, identify potential compensating controls for feedback into organizational strategy.</p>
<p>After initially conducted for a project, this must be updated and reviewed during the design phase or every development cycle. This activity should be conducted by a security auditor with relevant technical and business stakeholders.</p>

<p>###Consider security explicitly during the software requirements process</p>
<h5 id="a.-derive-security-requirements-from-business-functionality">A. Derive security requirements from business functionality</h5>
<p>Conduct a review of functional requirements that specify the business logic and overall behavior for each software project. After gathering requirements for a project, conduct an assessment to derive relevant security requirements. Even if software is being built by a third-party, these requirements, once identified, should be included with functional requirements delivered to vendors.</p>
<p>For each functional requirement, a security auditor should lead stakeholders through the process of explicitly noting any expectations with regard to security. Typically, questions to clarify for each requirement include expectations for data security, access control, transaction integrity, criticality of business function, separation of duties, uptime, etc.</p>
<p>It is important to ensure that all security requirements follow the same principles for writing good requirements in general. Specifically, they should be specific, measurable, and reasonable. Conduct this process for all new requirements on active projects. For existing features, it is recommended to conduct the same process as a gap analysis to fuel future refactoring for security.</p>
<h5 id="b.-evaluate-security-and-compliance-guidance-for-requirements">B. Evaluate security and compliance guidance for requirements</h5>
<p>Determine industry best-practices that project teams should treat as requirements. These can be chosen from publicly available guidelines, internal or external guidelines/standards/ policies, or established compliance requirements.</p>
<p>It is important to not attempt to bring in too many best-practice requirements into each development iteration since there is a time trade-off with design and implementation. The recommended approach is to slowly add best-practices over successive development cycles to bolster the software’s overall assurance profile over time.</p>
<p>For existing systems, refactoring for security best practices can be a complex undertaking. Where possible, add security requirements opportunistically when adding new features. At a minimum, conducting the analysis to identify applicable best practices should be done to help fuel future planning efforts.</p>
<p>This review should be performed by a security auditor with input from business stakeholders. Senior developers, architects, and other technical stakeholders should also be involved to bring design and implementation-specific knowledge into the decision process.</p>

Build an access control matrix for resources and capabilitiesBased upon the business purpose of the application, identify user and operator roles. Additionally, build a list of resources and capabilities by gathering all relevant data assets and application-specific features that are guarded by any form of access control.In a simple matrix with roles on one axis and resources on the other, consider the relationships between each role and each resource and note in each intersection the correct behavior of the system in terms of access control according to stakeholders.For data resources, it is important to note access rights in terms of creation, read access, update, and deletion. For resources that are features, gradation of access rights will likely be application-specific, but at a minimum, note if the role should be permitted accessto the feature.This permission matrix will serve as an artifact to document the correct access control rights for the business logic of the overall system. As such, it should be created by the project teams with input from business stakeholders. After initial creation, it should be updated by business stakeholders before every release, but usually toward the beginning of the design phase.</h5>

When available, draw on resources such as the high-level business risk profile, individual application threat models, findings from design review, code review, security testing, etc.In addition to review of existing artifacts, use abuse-case models for an application to serve as fuel for identification of concrete security requirements that directly or indirectly mitigate the abuse scenarios. This process should be conducted by business owners and security auditors as needed.Ultimately, the notion of risks leading to new security requirements should become a built-in step in the planning phase whereby newly discovered risks are specifically assessed by project teams.</h5>

Build security requirements into supplier agreementsBeyond the kinds of security requirements already identified by previous analysis, additional security benefits can be derived from third-party agreements. Typically, requirements and perhaps high-level design will be developed internally while detailed design and implementation is often left up to suppliers.Based on the specific division of labor for each externally developed component, identify specific security activities and technical assessment criteria to add to the vendor contracts. Commonly, this is a set of activities from the design review, code review, and securitytesting practices.Modifications of agreement language should be handled on a case-by-case basis with each supplier since adding additional requirements will generally mean an increase in cost. The cost of each potential security activity should be balanced against the benefit of the activity as per the usage of the component or system being considered.</h5>

Generally, these should be limited such that they only take a smallamount of extra effort beyond the normal implementation cost of functional requirements and anything larger should be noted and scheduled for future releases.While this process should be conducted by each project team after being trained with security awareness, it is helpful to incorporate more security-savvy staff to aid in making design decisions.</h5>

Identify security design patterns from architectureAcross software projects at an organization, each should be categorized in terms of the generic architecture type. Common categories include client-server applications, embedded systems, desktop applications, web-facing applications, web services platforms, transactional middleware systems, mainframe applications, etc. Depending on your organizations specialty, more detailed categories may need to be developed based upon language, or processor architecture, or even era of deployment.For the generic software architecture type, a set of general design patterns representing sound methods of implementing security functionality can be derived and applied to the individual designs of an organization’s software projects. These security design patterns represent general definitions of generic design elements they can be researched or purchased, and it is often even more effective if these patterns are customized to be made more specific to your organization. Example patterns include a single-sign-on subsystem, a cross-tier delegation model, a hardened interface design, separation-of-duties authorization model, a centralized logging pattern, etc.The process of identification of applicable and appropriate patterns should be carried out by architects, senior developers, and other technical stakeholders during the design phase.</h5>

<h5 id="a.-establish-formal-reference-architectures-and-platforms">A. Establish formal reference architectures and platforms</h5>
<p>After promoting integration with shared security services and working with security patterns specific to each type of architecture, a collection of code implementing these pieces of functionality should be selected from project teams and used as the basis for a shared code-base. This shared code-base can initially start as a collection of commonly recommended libraries that each project needs to use and it can grow over time into one or more software frameworks representing reference platforms upon which project teams build their software. Examples of reference platforms include frameworks for model view-controller web applications, libraries supporting transactional back-end systems, frameworks for web services platforms, scaffolding for client-server applications, frameworks for middle-ware with pluggable business logic, etc.</p>
<p>Another method of building initial reference platforms is to select a particular project early in the life-cycle and have security-savvy staff work with them to build the security functionality in a generic way so that it could be extracted from the project and utilized elsewhere in the organization.</p>
<p>Regardless of approach to creation, reference platforms have advantages in terms of shortening audit and security-related reviews, increasing efficiency in development, and lowering maintenance overhead.</p>
<p>Architects, senior developers and other technical stakeholders should participate in design and creation of reference platforms. After creation, a team must maintain ongoing support and updates.</p>

Validate usage of frameworks, patterns, and platformsDuring routine audits of projects conduct additional analysis of project artifacts to measure usage of recommended frameworks, design patterns, shared security services, and reference platforms. Though conducted during routine audits, the goal of this activity is to collect feedback from project teams as much as to measure their individual proactivesecurity effort.Overall, it is important to verify several factors with project teams. Identify use of non-recommended frameworks to determine if there may be a gap in recommendations versus the organization’s functionality needs. Examine unused or incorrectly used design patterns and reference platform modules to determine if updates are needed. Additionally, there may be more or different functionality that project teams would like to see implemented in the reference platforms as the organization evolves.

Identify software attack surfaceFor each software project, create a simplified view of the overall architecture. Typically, this should be created based on project artifacts such as high-level requirements and design documents, interviews with technical staff, or module-level review of the code base. It is important to capture the high-level modules in the system, but a good rule of thumb for granularity is to ensure that the diagram of the whole system under review fits onto one page.From the single page architecture view, analyze each component in terms of accessibility of the interfaces from authorized users, anonymous users, operators, application-specific roles, etc. The components providing the interfaces should also be considered in the context of the one-page view to find points of functional delegation or data pass-through to other components on the diagram. Group interfaces and components with similar accessibility profiles and capture this as the software attack surface.For each interface, further elaborate the one-page diagram to note any security-related functionality. Based on the identified interface groups comprising the attack surface, check the model for design-level consistency for how interfaces with similar access are secured. Any breaks in consistency can be noted as assessment findings.</h5>
<p>This analysis should be conducted by security-savvy technical staff, either within the project team or external. Typically, after initial creation, the diagram and attack surface analysis only needs to be updated during the design phase when additions or changes are made to the edge system interfaces.</p>

Analyze design against known security requirementsSecurity requirements, either formally identified or informally known, should be identified and collected. Additionally, identify and include any security assumptions upon which safe operation of the system relies.Review each item on the list of known security requirements against the one-page diagram of the system architecture. Elaborate the diagram to show the design-level features that address each security requirement. Separate, granular diagrams can be created to simplify capturing this information if the system is large and/or complex. The overall goal isto verify that each known security requirement has been addressed by the system design. Any security requirements that are not clearly provided at the design level should be noted as assessment findings.This analysis should be conducted by security-savvy technical staff with input from architects, developers, managers, and business owners as needed.

Develop data-flow diagrams for sensitive resourcesBased on the business function of the software project, conduct analysis to identify details on system behavior around high-risk functionality. Typically, high-risk functionality will correlate to features implementing creation, access, update, and deletion of sensitive data.</h5>
<p>Beyond data, high-risk functionality also includes project-specific business logic that is critical in nature, either from a denial-of-service or compromise perspective. For each identified data source or business function, select and use a standardized notation to capture relevant software modules, data sources, actors, and messages that flow amongst them. It is often helpful to start with a high-level design diagram and iteratively flesh out relevant detail while removing elements that do not correspond to the sensitive resource.With data-flow diagrams created for a project, conduct analysis over them to determine internal choke-points in the design. Generally, these will be individual software modules that handle data with differing sensitivity levels or those that gate access to several business functions of various levels of business criticality.</p>

Create review checklists from known security requirementsFrom the known security requirements for a project, derive a lightweightimplementation review checklist for security. These can be checks specific to the security concerns surrounding the functional requirements or checks for secure coding best practices based on the implementation language, platform, typical technology stack,etc. Due to these variations, often a set of checklist are needed to cover the different types of software development within an organization.</h5>
<p>Regardless of whether created from publicly available resources or purchased, technical stakeholders such as development managers, architects, developers, and security auditors should review the checklists for efficacy and feasibility. It is important to keep the lists short and simple, aiming to catch high-priority issues that are straightforward to find in code either manually or with simple search tools. Code analysis automation tools may also be used to achieve this same end, but should also be customized to reduce the overall set of security checks to a small, valuable set in order to make the scan and review process efficient.</p>
<p>Developers should be briefed on the goals of checklists appropriate to their job function.</p>

Perform point-review of high-risk codeSince code-level vulnerabilities can have dramatically increased impacts if they occur in security-critical parts of software, project teams should review high-risk modules for common vulnerabilities. Common examples of high-risk functionality include authentication modules, access control enforcement points, session management schemes, externalinterfaces, input validators and data parsers, etc.Utilizing the implementation review checklists, the analysis can be performed as a normal part of the development process where members of the project team are assigned modules to review when changes are made. Security auditors and automated review tools can also be utilized for the review.During development cycles where high-risk code is being changed and reviewed, development managers should triage the findings and prioritize remediation appropriately with input from other project stakeholders.</h5>

Integrate code analysis into development processOnce a code analysis solution is selected, it must be integrated into the development process to encourage project teams to utilize its capabilities. An effective way to accomplish this is to setup the infrastructure for the scans to run automatically at build time or from code in the project’s code repository. In this fashion, results are available earlier thus enabling development teams to self-check along the way before release.A potential problem with legacy systems or large ongoing projects is that code scanners will typically report findings in modules that were not being updated in the release. If automatic scanning is setup to run periodically, an effective strategy to avoid review overhead is to limit consideration of findings to those that have been added, removed, or changed since the previous scan. It is critical to not ignore the rest of the results however, so development managers should take input from security auditors, stakeholders, and the project team to formulate a concrete plan for addressing the rest of the findings.If unaddressed findings from implementation review remain at time of release, these must be reviewed, assigned a risk rating and accepted by project stakeholders.</h5>

Customize code analysis for application-specific concernsCode scanning tools are powered by built-in a knowledge-base of rules to check code based on language APIs and commonly used libraries, but have limited ability to understand custom APIs and designs to apply analogous checks. However, through customization, a code scanner can be a powerful, generic analysis engine for finding organization and project-specific security concerns.While details vary between tools in terms of ease and power of custom analysis, code scanner customization generally involves specifying checks to be performed at specific APIs and function call sites. Checks can include analysis for adherence to internal coding standards, unchecked tainted data being passed to custom interfaces, tracking and verification of sensitive data handling, correct usage of an internal API, etc.Checkers for usage of shared code-bases are an effective place to begin scanner customizations since the created checkers can be utilized across multiple projects. To customize a tool for a code-base, a security auditor should inspect both code and high-level design to identify candidate checkers to discuss with development staff and stakeholders for implementation.</h5>

Over time, this baseline standard should be improved by adding additional criteria for passing the checkpoint.Generally, the implementation review checkpoint should occur toward the end of the implementation phase, but must occur before release.</h5>

Integrate security testing into development processWith tools to run automated security tests, projects within the organization should routinely run security tests and review results during development. In order to make this scalable with low overhead, security testing tools should be configured to automatically run on a routine basis, e.g. nightly or weekly, and findings should be inspected as they occur.Conducting security tests as early as the requirements or design phases can be beneficial. While traditionally, used for functional test cases, this type of test-driven development approach involves identifying and running relevant security test cases early in the development cycle, usually during design. With the automatic execution of security testcases, projects enter the implementation phase with a number of failing tests for the nonexistent functionality. Implementation is complete when all the tests pass. This provides a clear, upfront goal for developers early in the development cycle, thus lowering risk of release delays due to security concerns or forced acceptance of risk in order to meetproject deadlines.For each project release, results from automated and manual security tests should be presented to management and business stakeholders for review. If there are unaddressed findings that remain as accepted risks for the release, stakeholders and development managers should work together to establish a concrete timeframe for addressing them.</h5>

Employ application-specific security testing automationThrough either customization of security testing tools, enhancements to generic test case execution tools, or buildout of custom test harnesses, project teams should formally iterate through security requirements and build a set of automated checkers to test the security of the implemented business logic.Additionally, many automated security testing tools can be greatly improved in accuracy and depth of coverage if they are customized to understand more detail about the specific software interfaces in the project under test. Further, organization-specific concerns fromcompliance or technical standards can be codified as a reusable, central test battery to make audit data collection and per-project management visibility simpler.Project teams should focus on buildout of granular security test cases based on the business functionality of their software, and an organization-level team led by a security auditor should focus on specification of automated tests for compliance and internalstandards.</h5>

Establish release gates for security testingTo prevent software from being released with easily found security bugs, a particular point in the software development lifecycle should be identified as a checkpoint where an established set of security test cases must pass in order to make a release from the project. This establishes a baseline for the kinds of security tests all projects are expected to pass.Since adding too many test cases initially can result in an overhead cost bubble, begin by choosing one or two security issues and include a wide variety of test cases for each with the expectation that no project may pass if any test fails. Over time, this baseline should be improved by selecting additional security issues and adding a variety of corresponding test cases.Generally, this security testing checkpoint should occur toward the end of the implementation or testing, but must occur before release.For legacy systems or inactive projects, an exception process should be created to allow those projects to continue operations, but with an explicitly assigned timeframe for mitigation of findings. Exceptions should be limited to no more that 20% of all projects.</h5>

While generally this responsibility will not claim much time from the individuals, the purpose of having a predetermined point of contact is to add structure and governance for vulnerabilitymanagement.Examples of incidents that might cause the utilization include receipt of a vulnerability report from an external entity, compromise or other security failure of software in the field, internal discovery of high-risk vulnerabilities, etc. In case of an event, the closest contact would step in as an extra resource and advisor to the affected project team(s) to provide technical guidance and brief other stakeholders on progress of mitigation efforts.The point of contact should be chosen from security-savvy technical or management staff with a breadth of knowledge over the software projects in the organization. A list of these assigned security points of contact should be centrally maintained and updated at least every six months. Additionally, publishing and advertising this list allows staff within the organization to request help and work directly with one another on security problems.</h5>

<p>The first and most common is through creation and deployment of security patches for the software produced by the organization. Generally, if all software projects are only use internally, then this becomes less critical, but for all contexts where the software is being operated by parties external to the organization, a patch release process must exist. It should provide for several factors including change management and regression testing prior to patch release, announcement to operators/users with assigned criticality category for the patch, sparse technical details so that an exploit cannot be directly derived, etc.Another avenue for external communications is with third parties that report security vulnerabilities in an organization’s software. By adopting and externally posting the expected process with timeframes for response, vulnerability reporters are encouraged to follow responsible disclosure practices.Lastly, many states and countries legally require external communications for incidents involving data theft of personally identifiable information and other sensitive data type. Should this type of incident occur, the security response team should work with managers and business stakeholders to determine appropriate next-steps.</p>

<p>This specification should be reviewed and updated at least every six months for active projects or more often if changes are being made to the software design or the expected operating environment.</p>

Establish routine patch management processMoving to a more formal process than ad hoc application of critical upgrades and patches, an ongoing process should be created in the organization to consistently apply updates to software dependencies in the operating environment.In the most basic form, the process should aim to make guarantees for time-lapse between release and application of security upgrades and patches. To make this process efficient, organizations typically accept high latency on lower priority updates, e.g. maximum of two days for critical patches spanning to a maximum of 30 days for low priority patches.</h5>
<p>This activity should be primarily conducted by support and operations staff, but routine meetings with development should also be conducted to keep the whole project abreast of past changes and scheduled upgrades.Additionally, development staff should share a list of third-party components upon which the software project internally depends so that support and operations staff can monitor those as well to cue development teams on when an upgrade is required.</p>

<p>There are both commercial and open-source tools available to provide this type of functionality, so project teams should select a solution based on appropriateness to the organization’s needs. Typical selection criteria includes ease of deployment and customization, applicability to the organization’s platforms and technology stacks, built-in features for change management and alerting, metrics collection and trend tracking etc.In addition to host and platform checks, monitoring automation should be customized to perform application-specific health checks and configuration verifications. Support and operations personnel should work with architects and developers to determine the optimal amount of monitoring for a given software project.</p>
<p>Ultimately, after a solution is deployed for monitoring the environment’s configuration status, unexpected alerts or configuration changes should be collected and regularly reviewed by project stakeholders as often as weekly but at least once per quarter.</p>

This enables the actual security posture of software at deployment sites to function in the same way that designers in the project team intended.This analysis should begin with architects and developers building a list of security features built-in to the software. From that list, information about configuration options and their security impact should be captured as well. For projects that offer several different deployment models, information about the security ramifications of each should be noted to better inform users and operators about the impact of their choices.Overall, the list should be lightweight and aim to capture the most critical information. Once initially created, it should be reviewed by the project team and business stakeholders for agreement. Additionally, it is effective to review this list with select operators or usersin order to ensure the information is understandable and actionable.

Perform code signing for application componentsThough often used with special-purpose software, code signing allows users and operators to perform integrity checks on software such that they can cryptographically verify the authenticity of a module or release. By signing software modules, the project team enables deployments to operate with a greater degree of assurance against any corruption or modification of the deployed software in its operating environment.Signing code incurs overhead for management of signing credentials for the organization. An organization must follow safe key management processes to ensure the ongoing confidentiality of the signing keys. When dealing with any cryptographic keys, project stakeholders mustalso consider plans for dealing with common operational problems related to cryptography such as key rotation, key compromise, or key loss.Since code signing is not appropriate for everything, architects and developers should work with security auditors and business stakeholders to determine which parts of the software should be signed. As projects evolve, this list should be reviewed with each release, especially when adding new modules or making changes to previously signed components.</h5>
